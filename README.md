# spine-analysis
Python tool for spine detection and analysis

- We can come up with a better name for the pipeline once it takes shape!

Currently:
- initial notebook discussed in meeting

To include/update:
- simplified notebook for training sm u-net
- simplified notebook for segmenting images with u-net and performing basic analysis of spines
- segmentation of dendrite
- automatic isolation of primary dendrite and exclude other dendrites/spines (size/length followed by distance transform)
- detection of spine neck
- Extract spine MIPs or 3D volumes for classification into spine type (mushroom, stubby, thin, filopodia...) 
- GUI for selecting folders, models, and analysis parameters
